# Emagister Coding Dojo - 30/11/2012 #

This coding dojo will consist mainly in two katas

  * Kata Roman Numerals
  * Kata Best Before
  
That you'll find in its respective folder.

## Rules ##

  * The problems described in each Kata should be solved using **strict** TDD. So all
  the TDD rules apply.
  
  * We are going to solve each problem in pairs using *ping pong pairing* modality.
  This is, by pairs, the *pilot* writes a failing unit-test and passes the control of
  the computer the co-pilot, who code the implementation and writes the next failing
  unit-test.
  
## Clues ##

  * Would be worth to have a predefined list of unit tests to implement (from Beck,
  in his book about TDD). So applications like [localtodos.com](http://localtodos.com)
  may be fine.

Fun coding! :D
